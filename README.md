# ML-selflearning
This repos is used to store models trained for self-learning purpose

File 'Tensorflow-ClothesClassifying.py' is used to trained models based on data from datasets in Keras using TF2. 
File 'Linear.py' is used to train the Linear model merely by the scikit-learn library.
File 'cv.py' is used to automatically detect answers in the answer sheet by openCV and extract text by tesseract. However, it hasn't worked properly for every kind of paper
