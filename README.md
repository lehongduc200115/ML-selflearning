# ML-selflearning
This repos is used to store models trained for self-learning purpose

File Tensorflow-ClothesClassifying.py is used to trained models based on data from datasets in keras using TF2.
File Linear.py is used to train Linear model merely by scikit-learn library.
File cv.py is used to automatically detect answers in answer sheet by openCV and extract text by tesseract. However it hasn't worked properly
